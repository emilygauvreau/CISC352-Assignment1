function minconflicts (CSP, maxsteps)
    current = initial complete assignment for csp
    for i = 1 to max steps do
        if current is a solution for csp then return current
        var = randomly chosen conflicted variable
        value = the value v for var that minimizes conflicts(var, v, current, csp)
        set var = value in current
    return failure



must find a iterative repair method where all queens start on the board
counts the number of conflicts
uses heuristic to decide how to fix
minimum conflicts heuristic moves the piece with the largest number of conflicts
    to a square in the same column where the conflicts are smallest

- a good start is to put each queen in a different row
